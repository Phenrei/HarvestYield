    <description>Simple update (literally just a recompile of the existing code) for 1.3, should still be compatible with older versions, but if not the original is still here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1461790308
	
	All credit for base code to Syrchalis of course, and this will be unlisted if it is updated.
	
	Original description:
	
	You think you know what the stat "Plant Harvest Yield" does? Well, let me surprise you - it does NOT increase the amount you get when you harvest plants, like "Mining Yield" does for ores.

It merely gives you a chance to fail below 100%, above 100% you do not gain anything.

This changes now! This small C# patch changes the method when harvesting plants so that below 100% nothing changes (you still have a chance to fail, but get 100% of the amount IF you succeed) - but above 100% you get more from the plant. If you have 177% plant harvest yield and the plant usually gives 10 berries, then you now get 17 or 18 (random).

Important: This mod removes the max values from all "yield" stats. This includes: MiningYield, AnimalGatherYield, PlantHarvestYield, ButcheryFleshEfficiency and ButcheryMechanoidEfficiency. Meaning those stats can now be more than 100%. Settings for this are in the mod settings menu.</description>
